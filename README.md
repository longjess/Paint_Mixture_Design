# Paint_Mixture_Design
An mixture design experiment on the effects of different ingredients on the drying time of homemade paint. The experiment design was a four-component simplex centroid mixture design. The ingredients used for the paints were flour, cornstarch, glue, and egg yolk.

This was my final project for Stanford's STATS263 Design of Experiments course in Autumn 2022.
