# Paint_Mixture_Design
An mixture design experiment on the effects of different ingredients on the drying time of homemade paint. The experiment design was a four-component simplex centroid mixture design. The ingredients used for the paints were flour, cornstarch, glue, and egg yolk.

This was my final project for Stanford's STATS263 Design of Experiments course in Autumn 2022.

The repository includes:
* experiment.csv: describes set up and results of the experiment 
* project_final_ver.R: R code for analyzing the experiment results using the package mixexp to fit various regression models (linear, quadratic, cubic), and producing plots (contour plots, response trace plots)
* report_final.pdf: final report on the project, including details about the goals of the experiment, the set up, the models, the results, and conclusion
* Photos depicting the materials used in the experiment and the process
